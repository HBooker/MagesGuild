Mage's Guild is an unfinished/unsubmitted prototype for Weekly Game Jam 111. Mage's Guild was designed to be a real-time puzzle game where commuters will continually spawn and queue up to travel through several portals. The portals would break down at random intervals, requiring the player to solve a puzzle in order to reactivate them. The player would win after 100 commuters make it through the portals. The player would lose if the queue became too long.
