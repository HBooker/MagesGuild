Mages Guild is an unfinished/unsubmitted prototype for Weekly Game Jam 111. Week 111's theme was portals. Mages Guild was designed to be a real-time puzzle game where people will continually spawn and queue up to travel through the portals. The portals would break down at random intervals, requiring the player to solve a puzzle in order to reactivate the portals. The player would win after successfully allowing 100 people through the portals. The player would lose if the queue became too long.
